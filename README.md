Census project 
You are requested to make a database named "project".
import the sql file given.
The project currently consists of five main php files - home.php, populate.php, login.php, explore.php and more.php.
home page is so designed that it can facilitate the users to view our product.
populate page mainly facilitates the login service. Census appointed counters have to enter their user credentials to verify themselves.
Once the counter is logged in, he/she is facilitated with a form and has to make the population details  through.
talking about explore section, it mainly facilitates search. Users have to search for district name of which they want to know the population details.
Population details will probably be shown in various graphical techniques. We do not take it into consideration for now, but yes we will  work on that.
